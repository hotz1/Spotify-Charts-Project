This repo stores the information and pages for the GitHub.io Website which I created for my final project in JSC370, alongside the information needed to compile a written report about my data.

The website includes interactive data visualizations for Spotify Charts data collected during the first three months of 2022, as well as data collected from the 2021 edition of the World Happiness Report.

The report is a short PDF with a detailed analysis of the data which I collected during the project and the tools used to learn more about the data which was sourced from the Spotify Charts website.

The website is located at https://hotz1.github.io/Spotify-Charts-Project/.
