<p>The following three plots show the average danceability, energy, and
valence of tracks on the Top 200 Spotify Tracks for their respective
countries during the first three months of 2022.</p>
<p>In each of the three plots shown below, each country with data on the
Spotify Charts website is represented by a circular marker. The marker’s
size is proportional to the logarithm of the total number of streams
among the country’s Top 200 Tracks on Spotify during the first three
months of 2022, and the marker’s colour is chosen based on the region
which the country is located in.</p>

<h2 class="tabset">Averages Weighted by Number of Streams:</h2>
<p>Similar to the three plots shown above, the following three plots
also show the average danceability, energy, and valence of tracks on the
Top 200 Spotify Tracks for their respective countries during the first
three months of 2022. As with the plots above, the markers’ sizes are
proportional to the total number of streams in the country, and the
colour of the country’s marker is representative of its geopolitical
region, as defined by the World Happiness Index data.</p>
<p>However, in this plot, we computed a weighted average of these three
metrics, where these metrics are weighted proportionally according to
the number of times that the track was streamed in the given country.
This may provide a more robust metric than simply computing the means,
as weighted means allow us to account for how popular a song is in a
particular country.</p>
